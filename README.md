Please check out the deployed website [here](http://brewerybros.herokuapp.com).

##About
Brewery is an ecommerce website where users can search for their favorite craft beers, add items to their cart, and checkout. 

Users can also sign up as shop owners, where they can sell different craft beers. Shop owners have the ability to customize their stores, and users can shop by specific store.

##Usage
Users without a Brewery account can add beers to their cart, edit the quantity and items in their cart and checkout but cannot manage their profile, see past orders or become a shop owner. If users want to sign up, we will merge their cart from their offline account. From there users can continue to manage their cart, see shops and purchase items with ease. 

Logged in users will also be able to manage their past and pending orders and have access to status updates from their purchase. Brewery will send confirmation emails, as the status of an order is updated. 

Users who signup as shop owners or those who have admin privileges are given a special dashboard where they can access and manage their pending orders.
